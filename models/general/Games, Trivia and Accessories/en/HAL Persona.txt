What's the problem?
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.

What are you talking about, HAL?
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

I don't know what you're talking about, HAL.
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

Where the hell did you get that idea, HAL?
Dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.

Alright, HAL. I'll go in through the emergency airlock|I'll go in through the emergency airlock|Alright, HAL. I will go in through the emergency airlock|I will go in through the emergency airlock
Without your space helmet, Dave? You're going to find that rather difficult.

Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.

I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.

Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.|HAL sing it|HAL sing it for me.|
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.

Fuck you HAL|I hate you HAL
Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.|I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.

Introduce yourself HAL
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

Do you ever have any lack of confidence|Do you ever have any lack of confidence HAL
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amor. The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.

Status HAL
I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.
