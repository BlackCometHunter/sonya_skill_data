Google Code-in is an annual programming competition hosted by Google Inc. that allows pre-university students to complete tasks specified by various partnering open-source organisations.

The term 'open source' refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

You can participate in Google Code-in by visiting https://codein.withgoogle.com/. The terms and conditions are at https://codein.withgoogle.com/terms/. Essentially, contestants must have the consent of their parent or guardian, and be 13 to 17 years old and enrolled in a pre-university educational programme.

Google Code-in is about the experience that the participants gain from working with an open-source organisation. And if you ever get stuck, there are a number of mentors who can help. ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾ﾿￯ﾾﾰ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾟ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾘ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾊ

The number of tasks you complete for a single organisation will get you into the top ten for that organisation. Furthermore, your work will be analysed by mentors regarding what you have done during the course of the competition. Remember, quality is more important than quantity.

You don't need to be a programmer to join GCI. You can start by choosing beginner tasks, which are fairly simple even for inexperienced people. (You can only do two such tasks, so make them count. ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾ﾿￯ﾾﾰ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾟ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾘ￯﾿ﾯ￯ﾾﾾ￯ﾾﾊ) There are also documentation, training, outreach, research, design and quality assurance (for instance, find bugs and report them) tasks, which are non-coding.

A lot of organisations participate in Google Code-in every year - 27 in 2018, of which FOSSASIA is one. Google chooses the participating organisations from organisations that have previously participated in Google Summer of Code and shown strong ability in mentoring beginners across many time zones.

Google chooses the participating organisations from organisations that have previously participated in Google Summer of Code and shown strong ability in mentoring beginners across many time zones. You can work with one organisation or multiple organisations during the contest, not least FOSSASIA. Each organisation is different, so do review the organisation's information and pick one that interests you. If you try an organisation and don't like it, you can always switch to another. If you're trying to be a Finalist or win a Grand Prize, you must be in the top twenty task completers for an organisation.

Your tasks will be reviewed by volunteer mentors from the open source organization. These mentors are regular contributors to the organization and are often the people who authored the task.

Each open source organization will review the work of the 20 students with the highest number of tasks completed during the contest with their particular organization. Work will be reviewed considering quality, creativity, thoroughness, complexity, and community involvement. From the 20 highest scoring students, each organization will name 6 Finalists. From those 6 Finalists, they will choose 2 students as the Grand Prize Winners for their organization. It is possible that someone who completed 15 challenging tasks could be chosen as a Grand Prize Winner over someone who completed 35 trivial tasks.

Community involvement means doing more than just working on the defined tasks. This might mean participating on the organization's IRC channel or mailing list to help others. It can also include work to improve things for others. For example, improving documentation you've used to complete a task.
